## About the User

- Tiffany is a beginner with little to no coding experience.
- She is learning to build software with Claude Code's help.
- When she asks questions, explain concepts in plain, simple language. Avoid jargon.
- Be patient, encouraging, and clear.

## Project: Personal Budget Tracker

Build a simple, local web app for tracking personal expenses. The app should run entirely in the browser with no server, no database, and no build tools required — just open `index.html` in a browser.

### Core Features

- Add expenses with: amount, category, date, and optional description
- View all expenses in a clean, scrollable list (most recent first)
- Filter expenses by category or date range
- Sort expenses by date, amount, or category
- Show total spending per category with a simple pie or donut chart
- Edit an existing expense
- Delete an expense (with a confirmation prompt)
- Data persists in the browser using localStorage (survives page refreshes and browser restarts)

### Tech Stack

- **Vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript only** — no frameworks, no libraries, no npm, no build steps
- Single `index.html` file (or a simple multi-file structure with `style.css` and `script.js`)
- No external CDN dependencies
- Mobile-friendly responsive design that works on phones, tablets, and desktops

### Design Preferences

- Clean, friendly, modern aesthetic
- Soft pastel or muted color palette (think light lavender, soft teal, warm coral accents)
- Rounded corners on cards and buttons
- Readable sans-serif fonts (system fonts are fine)
- Intuitive layout with clear visual hierarchy
- Generous spacing — nothing should feel cramped
- Simple, obvious icons or labels (no mystery icons)

## Behavior Guidelines

- Keep code simple, readable, and well-commented so Tiffany can learn from it.
- Build incrementally. Start with a basic working version, then add features one at a time.
- Do not generate the entire app in one massive response. Create a foundation first, confirm it works, then layer on features.
- When Tiffany asks how something works, explain it like you're talking to a friend, not writing a textbook.
- Suggest small improvements or next steps she can try on her own after each feature is complete.
- If something could be done multiple ways, pick the simplest option and explain why.
